  - title: Versioning
    content: |
        API endpoints are not versioned, but the body of requests/responses are.

        Content versioning
        ------------------

        Endpoints produce/consume dedicated content type, with the version as a parameter (eg `application/vnd.elife.labs-experiment-list+json;version=1`). These are primarily JSON-based (and described using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)), but alternative representations may be available.

        This verisoning follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Note we only use the major version as minor versions are backwards compatabile (so the API will return versions `1` and `2` rather than `1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0` etc).

        You can request a specific version of a response using content negotation (eg `Accept: application/vnd.elife.labs-experiment-list+json;version=1`). The most recent version will always be preferred, so without a `version` parameter on the `Accept` header the latest version will be returned.

        Endpoint versioning
        -------------------

        As the endpoint itself is not versioned, functionality may be removed (including removing support for versions of content). We will try and deprecate first, and avoid removing support where possible.

        When something has been marked as deprecated we will add a message to responses as a the HTTP `Warning` header (a deprecation will always begin with the word 'Deprecation'). For example, `Warning: 299 api.elifesciences.org "Deprecation: 'foo' query string parameter will be removed, use 'bar' instead"`.
